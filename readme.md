# NodeTrail Labs
Progressive, hands-on labs that follow _“Node.js – The Complete Guide”_  
*(Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller)*

> **Why this repo?**  
> Learning sticks best when you get your hands dirty.  
> Each numbered folder here is a self-contained mini-project that
> builds on the previous one—taking you from “Hello World” all the way to
> templating engines, SQL/Sequelize, sessions, authentication and more.
